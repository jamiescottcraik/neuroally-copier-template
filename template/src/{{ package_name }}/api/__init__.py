"""
src.{{ package_name }}.api

API layer for {{ project_name }}.
- Add FastAPI, Flask, or other web API endpoints here.
- Use this package to expose your project as a service (REST, GraphQL, etc).
- Keep business logic out of API filesâ€”import from `src/{{ package_name }}/service/` or similar.

Example usage:
    from src.{{ package_name }}.api import app  # (if using FastAPI)

"""

# Example: If using FastAPI, you might define `app` here.
# from fastapi import FastAPI
# app = FastAPI()

# Otherwise, leave as stub until implementing your API.
